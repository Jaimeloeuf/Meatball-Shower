            const game controls the game through changes of the game's state with reactive programming
            Created through an anonymous self-invoking function to use the function's closure.
            Self-invoking so that it is a singleton.
        
            
            @Defn  Variable definitions in this scope
            states:
                - Contains all the possible states of the game
            currentState:
                - Variable that keeps track of the current state of the game.

            @ Use case specification:
            user should be able to :
            - (Done) read the current state
            - set a new state
            - add a event handler for a change of state.
            - ? remove a event handler previously added
