/*  @Doc
    This module implements the Game controller, which is basically a State and Business logic controller,
    built on a Reactive programming layer provided by a EventBus object.

    It is created through an anonymous self-invoking function to use the function's closure.
    Self-invoking to create a singleton object, to ensure that there is only 1 Game controller.

    Built on top of a EventBus object which implements all the low level events and their event handling,
    thus Game controller is very application specific, keeping it clean and simple,
    providing users with method that wraps over all the EventBus usage.

    
    @Defn  Variable definitions in this scope
    states:
        - Contains all the possible states of the game
    currentState:
        - Variable that keeps track of the current state of the game.

    @ Use case specification:
    user should be able to :
    - (Done) read the current state
    - set a new state
    - add a event handler for a change of state.
    - ? remove a event handler previously added
